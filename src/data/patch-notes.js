// Patch notes (D-032): what's new in each version, for people using Eightfold. User-facing only,
// newest first; the technical record stays in CHANGELOG.md. Fixed text written here, rendered with
// esc(). The first patch is the newest, and the account chit marks it until it's been read.
// Voice: warm and a little silly, but the design rules still hold (sentence case, no exclamation
// marks outside katakana stickers, every number says what it counts).
